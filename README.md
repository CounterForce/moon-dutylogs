A Duty Logger Script For QBCore

I have developed a resource for RP servers to help departments like Police and EMS easily track the duty hours of their officers and doctors. Instead of relying on a Discord bot that can be easily forgotten or ignored, players can simply use the /onduty and /offduty commands to automatically start and stop their duty timer. The Chief of Police can also reset duty hours and check the duty hours of individual officers. This feature-rich system is designed to be user-friendly and streamline duty tracking for all parties involved.
